# 0x01 program strategies
IT IS WORTHWHILE TO MAP OUT A STRATEGY BEFORE STARTING TO CODE
# part A decomposition
a good decomposition will allow you to isolate the deatils for all tricky parts into just a few functions.

# part B incremental
do not try to solve it the entire task at ONCE.

when you are ready to implement, focus on implementing features one at a time.
